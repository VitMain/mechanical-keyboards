# 3D Printing

These are the STL files I used: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4372836

Thanks, [Kevin Eckert](https://www.thingiverse.com/scablands), for sharing your Design.

The keyboard was printed on a [Tronxy XY-2 PRO](https://www.tronxy.com/product/xy-2-pro-fdm-3d-printer/) using default settings (as far as I remember).
In the QMK version the GX16 connector was used to connect both halves. In the ZMK version I used these holes to place a switch for turning on and off the mcu's.
